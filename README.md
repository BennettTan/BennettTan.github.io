# About Me 

My name is Bennett Tan. I am a first year student who is currently based in Coquitlam, Canada and is keen in majoring in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia (UBC). Technology has always fascinated me from a young age, however, I never considered learning about the industry as I always believed that I could never see programming as anything but daunting.

            Nevertheless, with my friend's encouragement, I decided to take a chance with an introductory ComSci course at UBC in my first year and immediately fell in love with the creative, yet logical aspect to programming. To me, programming is the means that represent the endless possibilities in which the world can be dramatically changed. All changes, however, must start somewhere, even if that somewhere is writing "hello world." :)
