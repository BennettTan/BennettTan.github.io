                    My name is Bennett Tan. I am a first year student who is currently based in Coquitlam, Canada and is
                    keen in majoring in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia (UBC). Technology has
                    always fascinated me from a young age, however, I never considered learning about the industry as I
                    always believed that I could never see programming as anything but daunting.

                    After taking some time out of school to serve Singapore's mandatory National Service, I came
                    to the realization that I've never given Computer Science a fair chance as a possible field I would
                    like to study. With my friend's encouragement, I took a chance with an introductory ComSci course at
                    UBC and immediately fell in love with the creative, yet logical aspect to programming.
