                    My name is Bennett Tan. I am a first year student who is currently based in Coquitlam, Canada and is
                    keen in majoring in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia (UBC). Technology has
                    always fascinated me from a young age, however, I never considered learning about the industry as I
                    always believed that I could never see programming as anything but daunting.
                </p>

                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                    Nevertheless, with my friend's encouragement, I decided to take a chance with an introductory ComSci
                    course at UBC in my first year and immediately fell in love with the creative, yet logical aspect to
                    programming. To me, programming is the means that represent the endless possibilities in which the
                    world can be dramatically changed. All change, however, starts somewhere, even if that
                    somewhere is writing your first "hello world." :)
